# Bitcoin-Prediction
To predict Bitcoin prices, combine Lasso regression for feature selection with LSTM for time series forecasting. Preprocess historical data, apply Lasso to identify key predictors, then train an LSTM model on the selected features. This approach leverages linear trends and complex patterns for improved price prediction accuracy.
